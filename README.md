2. Machine Learning (Stanford University)
3. Getting Started with Tensorflow 2 (Imperial College, London)

#### Guided Projects  
**1. Graduate Admission Prediction**  
**2. Image Synthesis using DCGANS**  
**3. Traffic Sign Classification**  
* The German Traffic Sign Benchmark (GTSRB) is a multi-class, single image classification dataset which can be used for developing a Traffic Sign Classification system for smart vehicles. Through this project, I would like to demonstrate a DNN-powered model specifically designed for smart vehicles which shall require this feature during the auto-pilot mode.
